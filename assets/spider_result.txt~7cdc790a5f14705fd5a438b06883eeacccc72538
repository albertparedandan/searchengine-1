Prof. Lei Chen's research is motivated by new technologies and applications through mining/learning the spatial-temporal knowledge and exploiting the wisdom of crowds to facilitate people's daily life. By collaborating with DiDi Chuxing (the biggest online car-hailing company in Mainland China), Prof. Chen's team can utilize the huge amount of data generated by millions of drivers and customers to help the company improve the efficiency of their services and the user experience of both drivers and customers. One such service, ridesharing, which allows drivers to share their empty seats to different groups of customers as long as the detours are acceptable, has a huge potential to alleviate the shortage of vehicles and increase the throughput of the platform. With ridesharing, customers can enjoy relatively cheaper transportation services with guarantees, such as the suitability of fellow travelers and the deadline of delivery. However, to operate a good ridesharing service is challenging. Prof. Chen's team has helped DiDi to design smart vehicle dispatching strategies and dynamic pricing strategies such that the efficiency of the ridesharing service can be improved, and the overall profit of the platform can be increased. Prof. Chen's team also collaborates with WeChat (at Tencent) in exploiting the wisdom of humans to boost the performance of machine learning models. Recently, although many accurate models have been developed to recognize images, translate languages and compose songs (some models are even more accurate than humans in image recognition), humans are still better than machines in discovering errors, learning new items and feeling emotion. Prof. Chen's team has studied methods to combine the advantages of humans and machines to build better machine learning models benefitting our daily life with human feedback used to iteratively improve the current models.

Developed by a team led by Prof Gary Chan of the Department of the Computer Science and Engineering, the location sensing technology – a software suite which fuses Wi-Fi with other signals on mobile platforms – is the first of its kind deployed in Hong Kong. It could reduce the position error to less than 2.5 meters in general environment, three times more accurate than traditional approaches. To locate a person, the technology combines signals from multiple sources such as Wi-Fi, geomagnetic field, Bluetooth, video and accelerometer reading. It has been deployed in Harbour City at Tsim Sha Tsui, and is now under commercial trials in malls (in collaboration with New World Development Research and Development, PCCW Solutions, and Link) and hospitals. "Existing location-based technologies often draw signals from a single source. As different signals have different limitations, their accuracy is not so satisfactory and their application environment is not general enough," said Prof Chan, also Director of Entrepreneurship Center at HKUST. "Our technology is to fuse the signals to combine their strengths while overcoming their limitations. The higher location accuracy makes possible novel location-based services and facilitates Hong Kong's development as a smart city." The technology can also create synergy with the government's smart lamp posts pilot scheme announced earlier as an initiative of the Smart City Blueprint, which plans to install multifunctional smart lamp posts starting 2019 to facilitate collection of real-time city data in enhancing city management and other public services. Incorporated with the technology, the lamp posts will not only provide timely location-based services to tourists and general public, but will also create immense social value on helping to find missing people, pets and preventing them from getting lost. Funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission's Innovation and Technology Fund and managed by Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies (LSCM R&D Center), Prof Chan's technology is now being commercialized through two start-ups run by HKUST graduates. The fusion technology is based on fingerprinting. Survey is first conducted to collect the signals at different locations of a given site. Using machine learning, the signal's characteristics at these locations are analyzed and modeled. Upon detecting signals from a user, the location of the user can then be estimated accurately and efficiently. Patents of the technology have been filed in the US and mainland China.

There exist many different ways of helping a user to solve this problem. One is an interactive approach which asks the user a number of questions (e.g., presenting two records and asking the user to choose a more preferable record) and then learns the user's preference automatically. Another is a log-oriented approach which analyzes the user's log data recorded by the system and learns the user's preferences via some data mining and deep learning approaches. After a user's preference is found, his/her favorite record can be easily determined. The following figure shows a scenario of our interactive approach. Consider that a user would like to find his/her favorite car. After asking the user about 5-7 questions, our system is able to know the user's preference and find his/her favorite car. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods in the literature of machine learning and database require asking the user about four times as many questions as in our system, which is tedious for the user. The figure below shows the user interface of our demo system that helps a user find his/her favorite car. Consider the log-oriented approach. Whenever a user visits a website, all activities of the user can be tracked. We proposed to use a recurrent neural network-based approach to model a user's preference in order to find the record that s/he is interested in. Our experimental result shows that the accuracy of our proposed approach is better than the best-known result. Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong has led a research team working on this project.

TITLE: Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics on e-Learning Platforms | HKUST CSE

This is one of the major challenges faced by today's e-learning platforms, particularly massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera and edX which have students from all over the world. A research team led by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung, with collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been developing advanced learning analytics tools to improve online education using machine learning technologies. As a project funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Government under the HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium, the approach adopted by the team is centered around the notion of personalization. The research mission is to significantly improve the learning effectiveness of e-learning platforms through personalization without having to pare down the massive scale and high learner-to-teacher ratio of the courses. Their personalized e-learning tools monitor the clickstream events of the learners for all the online activities, which include video lecture viewing, discussion forum participation, assignment submission, and quiz/exam performance. Based on the user profiles built and continuously updated, the learning performance of each learner is assessed and predicted with respect to a wide range of performance indicators using ensemble learning and temporal learning models which include recurrent neural network models. The goal is to identify the underperforming learners and their areas of underperformance and to help them improve using two other components of the system, the study plan generator and the AI tutor. Some of the predictive analytics tools that the team members have developed using machine learning techniques for temporal sequence data include predicting the grade distribution at the end of a course, analyzing the effect of each feature of the machine learning model on performance prediction, identifying learners and zooming into each of them to understand why there is a significant drop in the predicted performance within a short period of time, and providing recommendation on additional learning activities to make improvement with respect to various specific performance indicators. Based on similar machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, Prof. Yeung and two of his research team members recently participated in an international educational data mining competition, the 2017 ASSISTments Data Mining Competition. The dataset provided by the competition contains massive data for several hundred students, ranging from the detailed interaction data collected on the popular ASSISTments learning platform when they were middle school students, to career choice data of the students after they graduated from university. The goal was to use the ASSISTments interaction data to predict which students would, a few years later, enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate school programs and later STEM careers. Of the 74 teams of researchers participated in the competition, Prof. Yeung's team was awarded the first place. They developed a recurrent neural network model augmented with novel regularizers to address some problems encountered by existing knowledge tracing models to learn semantically meaningful features related to the knowledge states of different mathematical skills. They then made use of these learned features to augment the other static features extracted directly from the ASSISTments interaction data to boost the STEM prediction accuracy.

It is a very important problem because it facilitates drivers by predicting road conditions, enhances flight safety by providing weather guidance for regional aviation, avoids casualties by issuing citywide rainfall alerts, among many possibilities. In addition to the inherent complexities of the atmosphere and relevant dynamical processes, the ever-growing need for real-time, large-scale, and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting poses extra challenges to the meteorological community and has aroused research interest in the machine learning community. A simplified version of the problem is illustrated below. After receiving a sequence of radar echo maps up to the current time step, the task is to predict the radar echo maps in the next few time steps based on which rainfall intensities in specific locations can be estimated. For example, the radar maps are taken from the weather radar every six minutes. Over the past few years, Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and his research students have collaborated with the Hong Kong Observatory to solve the precipitation nowcasting problem using weather radar data collected in Hong Kong since 2009. By formulating precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, they first proposed the ConvLSTM model [Shi et al., 2015] by incorporating convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Using the radar echo data collected in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2013 for model training, ConvLSTM gives more accurate predictions than the current algorithm used by the Hong Kong Observatory which is based on estimating the optical flow. Recently, the team proposed a more general model called TrajGRU [Shi et al, 2017] which extends ConvLSTM in several important dimensions. A major extension is that TrajGRU can actively learn the location-variant structure for the recurrent connections in the RNN model and hence can handle more natural motion and transformation such as rotation. Moreover, the dataset has been extended to cover seven years, from 2009 to 2015. Because of the further improvement in prediction accuracy, the Hong Kong Observatory is currently porting the TrajGRU implementation to their online system for more thorough testing. This collaborative project benefits both the academic researchers and the practitioners in that it has led to publications in a top machine learning conference as well as deliverables that are being incorporated into the operational system for real-world weather forecasting.

The research by Prof. Qifeng Chen shows that an AI program can successfully render fictional novel scenes based on human input. As shown in the first figure, the deep learning model called the cascaded refinement network is able to generate photographic images based on semantic layouts. Learning-based image synthesis is connected to central problems in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, consider the problem of photorealism in computer graphics. A system that synthesizes photorealistic images from semantic layouts would in effect function as a kind of rendering engine that bypasses the laborious specification of detailed three-dimensional geometry and surface reflectance distributions, and avoids computationally intensive light transport simulation. Another source of motivation is the role of mental imagery and simulation in human cognition. Mental imagery is believed to play an important role in planning and decision making. The level of detail and completeness of mental imagery is a matter of debate, but its role in human intelligence suggests that the ability to synthesize photorealistic images may support the development of artificial intelligent systems. More recently, the research of Qifeng studies a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The second figure shows the image synthesis results by the semi-parametric approach. This approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material.

These are the criteria that count for data analysts and business users who need to perform analytical queries on a large amount of data with complex conditions and return aggregated results that can enable decisions to be made. For example, a sales director of a company handling millions of transactions per day might be interested to know the total revenue of all transactions for a specific product category in a certain period of time, where the buyer and seller are in specific regions, and the product has parts manufactured in yet another region. Yet, long running times for such analytical queries, even in leading, commercial-level database systems, are still among the major challenges to overcome. Prof Ke Yi, an expert in database systems and algorithms, has solved a problem that has taxed the community for over 15 years, enabling responses to queries to be given in seconds rather than minutes or hours. Prof Yi and his team's novel algorithm allows the database to return approximate results in a very short time, and continue to improve their accuracy as more time is spent. Working on datasets of 100 gigabytes and larger, their "Wander Join" algorithm achieves more effective sampling through random walks, returning results with the same accuracy (for example, 95% confidence and 1%error) in one-hundredth of the time compared with prior solutions on the same hardware. The algorithm has been integrated into PostgreSQL, Spark, as well as Oracle through PL/SQL, demonstrating its viability in a variety of settings and bringing the sought-after goal of interactive data analysis a step closer. This work was carried out in collaboration with the University of Utah, and has received the 2016 ACM SIGMOD Best Paper Award.

While they seem to be jargons to many, the related technologies are making impacts on how software changes the world. In highly competitive software markets, companies need to ship reliable software products that their clients can trust. As such, software quality is one of their top concerns. What if you are told that a bot will learn your program and write tests for you? What if you are further told that the bot will learn from test execution results and locate where the faults in your program reside? What if the bot can even fix the faults for you when you are crossing your fingers? CASTLE is research team led by Prof Shing-Chi Cheung to study the state-of-the-arts technologies on code analysis, testing and learning. Besides pursuing the advancement in automated test generation, fault localization and program repair, CASTLE is solving the challenging problem of automated program synthesis. Techniques developed are supported by tools that can be applied by users on their software applications. The following are the overviews of two CASTLE research projects that automatically locate program faults for enterprise and mobile applications by blending state-of-the-arts software engineering, big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Locating Crash-inducing Changes Software crashes are severe manifestation of software bugs that result in poor user experiences. To facilitate the diagnosis of crashing bugs, crash reporting systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows Error Reporting) have been deployed to collect crash reports automatically. Nevertheless, developers still require much manual effort in debugging crashes. Although there are many crash analysis techniques proposed to help diagnose crashes, we still have very limited understanding on existing crash diagnosis practice. CASTLE found that crash-inducing changes are one critical piece of debugging information and thereby proposed efficient techniques with support tools to automatically locate crash-inducing changes. Upon crash diagnosis, developers can integrate these tools into existing crash reporting systems, such as Microsoft Crash Reporting. The tools can be incorporated into products, deploying a crash reporting system. Taming Android Fragmentation Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it difficult for Android app developers to assure the compatibility of their software across these models and system versions. CASTLE developed analysis techniques and support tools to automatically mine and detect Android compatibility issues. The tools report actionable debugging information when it detects potential issues. Android app developers can deploy the tools to their code and detect potential incompatibility issues that may arise across device models and system versions. For each reported issue, app developers may validate the issue by running their app on the concerned device models or system versions. Android device vendors may also follow the methodology to address compatibility problems in their products arising from the fragmentation in their OS releases, library versions and hardware configurations.

Bugs in our programs such as the Heartbleed (2014) and WannaCry (2017) cost billions of dollars to fix and generate drastic social impacts. A key reason is that modern software vulnerability detection technology does not catch up with the size and the complexity of real world software system. To scale, these techniques typically relax the scanning strength, producing a lot of noise in the results, or restrict the scope, missing critical issues. Both compromises render software systems to eminent threats. Pinpoint is a new technique, designed by Prof. Charles Zhang and his research team in the Cybersecurity Laboratory, leveraging clever designs in static analysis, a methodology for predicting software behaviour through logic deduction, to discover dangerous vulnerabilities in large modern software systems. Pinpoint takes a "holistic" approach in combining the analysis of lower level memory behaviour of software systems together with the high level detection of logic errors and, thus, dramatically reducing the amount of computation. The following diagram illustrates the basic operation of Pinpoint. It is capable of detecting over 40 types of different software vulnerabilities in system as large as eight millions of lines of code within a few hours. It has discovered over 80 confirmed issues in high quality open source systems such as MySQL and Firefox. Pinpoint is also being used by world leading technical firms such as Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei. You can use Pinpoint either through the Pinpoint Online Scan or download a special PLDI desktop version, commemorating the publishing of its core technology in ACM SIGPLAN PLDI conference in 2018.

From daily mobile payment to personal healthcare monitoring, smart devices have penetrated into every part of our life. Along with the great convenience of smart devices, there also comes an increasing concern about their security issues, as the data involved is often extremely valuable and highly sensitive, gaining much attention from malicious attackers. Also, the limited computing resource, growing data transmission capability and expanding device-device connectivity have aggravated the security threats. As a result, securing the ecosystem of smart devices has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. Among the research pioneers is Prof. Qian Zhang, who envisioned many years ago that great potential and serious threats coexist in smart devices. One major research of Prof. Zhang's group in HKUST is to build reliable and robust securing systems for smart devices, including the following aspects: (1) User-device interaction defines how the user accesses the device. From the perspective of security design, Prof. Zhang's group focuses on recognizing who is using the smart device. Existing user identification solutions either rely on expensive hardware, e.g., fingerprints, or require complex modeling and large computation power. As both the computation and battery are scarce resources on many smart devices, existing solutions do not work well. To fill the gap, Prof. Zhang's group builds two light-weight user identification systems for power-constrained devices. One uses the underlying pattern hidden in the human gesture dynamics as an identifier while the other one leverages the bio-vibrometry, i.e., the vibration response of the human body, to differentiate various users. According to their comprehensive evaluations on the volunteers, both systems can provide identification accuracy above 91% in small-scale scenarios of limited users (e.g., home scenario) with minimal power requirement and are robust to various confounding factors. (2) Fueled by the close cooperation among smart devices, the device-device connection is prevalent and forming secure pairing between devices lays the foundations of the security protection and data privacy preservation. Prof. Zhang's group has devoted much effort in this field and successfully built several systems, each of which targets different scenarios and provides various security levels. Touch-And-Guard (TAG) is their first research outcome. It uses hand touch as an intuitive means to establish a secure connection between a wristband wearable and the touched device. Specifically, it generates secret bits from hand resonant properties and uses it to authenticate each other and then communicate confidentially. The evaluations on 12 volunteers indicate that TAG can serve as a natural and user-friendly pairing interface by generating secret bits at a rate of 7.84 bit/s, 58% faster than conventional text input PIN authentication. Apart from that, a proximity-based mechanism with a better security level, Move2Auth, is also proposed. In Move2Auth, a user only needs to hold the smartphone and perform random rotations in front of the IoT device. As the rotations lead to significant variations and fast changes in signal attenuation and antenna polarization, a secure and random key can be extracted from the Received Signal Strength (RSS). By matching the RSS-trace and motion data captured by the built-in motion sensors on the smartphone, Move2Auth can create a secure link between these devices and can protect against a powerful active attacker who can arbitrarily tune transmission power. To further boost the security level, the research group also explored the possibility of secure pairing based on human bio-metrics: the Electromyogram signal (EMG) caused by human muscle contraction. By exploring stochastic nature hidden in the EMG signal to generate secure bits, their work proves that the secure key generated from the EMG signal has sufficient randomness and security--even when the attacker can perfectly copy the user's gesture, the generated secure key cannot be stolen or cracked. Extensive evaluation on the volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that this system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a very high-security level. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrates that their system is very secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture, or even imitate the legitimate pairing process with the help of advanced computer-vision-based techniques. (3) In the context of device-environment sensing, Prof. Zhang and her group members have explored the possible security attacks caused by the continuous, unobtrusive, and unrestricted sensing ability of mobile devices. They first investigate how to prevent mobile-camera-based piracy attack on physical intellectual properties, such as painting and sculpture. To this end, a new lighting system, Rainbow, is invented to pollute the pirate photo/video on the mobile camera but retains a good visual quality for the human observer. By carefully modulating the chromatic change and luminance flicker into the light system, Rainbow introduces a non-uniform variation into the reflected light energy from physical objects, thus maximizing the distortion caused by the camera's banding effect. Meanwhile, due to the color fusion ability and low-band pass characteristics of human vision, the visual quality for the human observer is not affected. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios indicate that this lighting system is robust with different confounding factors and can significantly pollute the piracy photos on various devices. After that, another potential but serious information leakage attack is also exhibited by demonstrating how the attacker can unobtrusively track users in an indoor scenario. The key is to explore the nonlinearity characteristics of the ambient light sensor to sense the high-frequency modulated location information with a low sampling rate. In particular, due to the nonlinear characteristics of electronic components inside the circuit, the amplifier in ALS exhibits some levels of nonlinearity. When two high-frequency signals are received by the ALS simultaneously, such nonlinearity renders the output signal of the amplifier violate the linear superposition rule and generate a low-frequency "shadow" signal. In light of this idea, the research group has built a low-power and unobtrusive indoor localization system, NALoc. The experiments on ALS sensors from Apple and Samsung devices confirm the feasibility of such a system and extensive experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive the fine-grained location information unobtrusively from the ALS readings, which poses a brand-new security threat. Corresponding countermeasures are also discussed in their research paper.

TITLE: Robo-lawyer: A Contract Generator Chatbot | HKUST CSE

More about HKUST University News Academic Departments A-Z Life@HKUST Library Map & Directions Jobs@HKUST Faculty Profiles About HKUST Intranet School of Engineering Quick Links for Undergraduates Postgraduates Faculty & Staff Alumni Job Seekers Employers & Industry Partners About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements School of Engineering Robo-lawyer: A Contract Generator Chatbot A research team led by Prof. Yangqiu SONG has developed a Robo-lawyer system to assist humans to interactively and (semi-)automatically generate contracts. The Robo-lawyer is an AI-based real system geared towards the masses. Its primary task is to sort out essential matters for drafting the agreement from user's input of several questions. The user can retrieve an agreement only if he/she can answer all questions, showing that they have thoroughly considered all the matters of concerns. The Robo-lawyer system has many applications in different domains. The current system supports divorce and employment contracts. For example, Hong Kong's divorce rate in 2016 was more than double that in 1991. The rising demand for family mediation has been a mounting challenge for lawyers. Few divorcing couples actually realized that the high legal costs and procedural drag would take an emotional toll on themselves. Many of them are unwilling or unable to sit down for a mediation that could take months or years, especially for cross-border couples. A chatbot specialized in generating divorce agreements contracts can help them get through the process easier. To make the Robo-lawyer more like a real person, sentiment analysis has been employed to help identify true feelings and moods of a person heading to a divorce through the dialogue. When a user writes "I am glad", for instance, it should be interpreted as an expression of relief instead of being upbeat. It even makes effort to persuade couples to think twice before finally deciding to divorce. Watch a demo of the current system. This is a collaborative project with Albert SO, a CSE alumnus from HKUST, who chairs the Hong Kong Mediation and Arbitration Centre.
