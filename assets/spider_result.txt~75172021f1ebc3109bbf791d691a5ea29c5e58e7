This is precisely the work being prototyped by PhD student Bing Yen CHANG and Prof. Andrew Horner in the Computer Music group. Listeners can direct where the music goes emotionally like a Movie Director guides how the composer develops the score. It is a new form of active listening! Listeners can take their favorite music to places it has never gone before, but could! They can bring out different emotional potential of the music - even some that may be deeply hidden in the music. For example, imagine Canon in D, but with an Angry tone - rendered in harmonic minor with a menacing quality like Phantom of the Opera or The Empire Strikes Back. Or, perhaps Tragic like a funeral march, or Lively like a Celtic folk dance on Irish flute, or Tenderly-Romantic like a love ballad. You don't have to imagine anymore, check it out: Canon in D. Every piece of music can be shaded or shaped to bring out the full range of emotional characteristics, in a similar way that Monet's Rouen Cathedral appears in dozens of different characters depending on the light and color (i.e., time of day, weather, lighting, shadows). He uses the same subject, the same viewpoint, the same style, but the different lighting and colors produce different moods. Paintings from Monet's Rouen Cathedral series. How can we similarly "shade" or "color" music so that is has different mood or emotional characteristics? The three main musical parameters for excitement level are pitch register (i.e., which octave), tempo, dynamics. We see this in real-life in over-excited trumpet players, who always want to play higher, faster, and louder! For the mood of the music (how positive or negative it is), the main musical factors are the particular mode of the music (e.g., major or minor), to a lesser extent the overall pitch range (high or low), and other melodic and harmonic aspects. In the near future, imagine bringing to life your own Carmen! Though your control of the music, play the matador Escamilla in the bullfight scene, and guide the music to parry the charges of a furious bull in the dusty ring while the screaming crowd cheers and gasps. Or, guide Carmen's dance that mesmerizes the carousing soldiers in the opening Habanera scene. Or, through your own emotional twists in the music, play Carmen in the final tragic encounter with her jealous former lover Don Jose outside the bullfight stadium with defiant bravado. What happens if Carmen successfully fights back? Or, what if she escapes to the bullring, facing off with Don Jose, Escamilla, and the bull, writing a new ending to the opera, with your version of the music telling the tale!

There exist many different ways of helping a user to solve this problem. One is an interactive approach which asks the user a number of questions (e.g., presenting two records and asking the user to choose a more preferable record) and then learns the user's preference automatically. Another is a log-oriented approach which analyzes the user's log data recorded by the system and learns the user's preferences via some data mining and deep learning approaches. After a user's preference is found, his/her favorite record can be easily determined. The following figure shows a scenario of our interactive approach. Consider that a user would like to find his/her favorite car. After asking the user about 5-7 questions, our system is able to know the user's preference and find his/her favorite car. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods in the literature of machine learning and database require asking the user about four times as many questions as in our system, which is tedious for the user. The figure below shows the user interface of our demo system that helps a user find his/her favorite car. Consider the log-oriented approach. Whenever a user visits a website, all activities of the user can be tracked. We proposed to use a recurrent neural network-based approach to model a user's preference in order to find the record that s/he is interested in. Our experimental result shows that the accuracy of our proposed approach is better than the best-known result. Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong has led a research team working on this project.

TITLE: Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics on e-Learning Platforms | HKUST CSE

This is one of the major challenges faced by today's e-learning platforms, particularly massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera and edX which have students from all over the world. A research team led by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung, with collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been developing advanced learning analytics tools to improve online education using machine learning technologies. As a project funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Government under the HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium, the approach adopted by the team is centered around the notion of personalization. The research mission is to significantly improve the learning effectiveness of e-learning platforms through personalization without having to pare down the massive scale and high learner-to-teacher ratio of the courses. Their personalized e-learning tools monitor the clickstream events of the learners for all the online activities, which include video lecture viewing, discussion forum participation, assignment submission, and quiz/exam performance. Based on the user profiles built and continuously updated, the learning performance of each learner is assessed and predicted with respect to a wide range of performance indicators using ensemble learning and temporal learning models which include recurrent neural network models. The goal is to identify the underperforming learners and their areas of underperformance and to help them improve using two other components of the system, the study plan generator and the AI tutor. Some of the predictive analytics tools that the team members have developed using machine learning techniques for temporal sequence data include predicting the grade distribution at the end of a course, analyzing the effect of each feature of the machine learning model on performance prediction, identifying learners and zooming into each of them to understand why there is a significant drop in the predicted performance within a short period of time, and providing recommendation on additional learning activities to make improvement with respect to various specific performance indicators. Based on similar machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, Prof. Yeung and two of his research team members recently participated in an international educational data mining competition, the 2017 ASSISTments Data Mining Competition. The dataset provided by the competition contains massive data for several hundred students, ranging from the detailed interaction data collected on the popular ASSISTments learning platform when they were middle school students, to career choice data of the students after they graduated from university. The goal was to use the ASSISTments interaction data to predict which students would, a few years later, enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate school programs and later STEM careers. Of the 74 teams of researchers participated in the competition, Prof. Yeung's team was awarded the first place. They developed a recurrent neural network model augmented with novel regularizers to address some problems encountered by existing knowledge tracing models to learn semantically meaningful features related to the knowledge states of different mathematical skills. They then made use of these learned features to augment the other static features extracted directly from the ASSISTments interaction data to boost the STEM prediction accuracy.

TITLE: Approximate Query Processing | HKUST CSE

These are the criteria that count for data analysts and business users who need to perform analytical queries on a large amount of data with complex conditions and return aggregated results that can enable decisions to be made. For example, a sales director of a company handling millions of transactions per day might be interested to know the total revenue of all transactions for a specific product category in a certain period of time, where the buyer and seller are in specific regions, and the product has parts manufactured in yet another region. Yet, long running times for such analytical queries, even in leading, commercial-level database systems, are still among the major challenges to overcome. Prof Ke Yi, an expert in database systems and algorithms, has solved a problem that has taxed the community for over 15 years, enabling responses to queries to be given in seconds rather than minutes or hours. Prof Yi and his team's novel algorithm allows the database to return approximate results in a very short time, and continue to improve their accuracy as more time is spent. Working on datasets of 100 gigabytes and larger, their "Wander Join" algorithm achieves more effective sampling through random walks, returning results with the same accuracy (for example, 95% confidence and 1%error) in one-hundredth of the time compared with prior solutions on the same hardware. The algorithm has been integrated into PostgreSQL, Spark, as well as Oracle through PL/SQL, demonstrating its viability in a variety of settings and bringing the sought-after goal of interactive data analysis a step closer. This work was carried out in collaboration with the University of Utah, and has received the 2016 ACM SIGMOD Best Paper Award.

Through the efforts of researchers and engineers, computers have evolved from large, slow, expensive, and very specialized systems to small, fast, affordable, and ordinary tools that are part of virtually everyone's life. Advances in networking technologies and human-computer interfacing technologies have further created a digital culture. The ubiquitous nature of computers in today's workplace and home environment is making computer literacy a requirement not only for all professionals in industrial societies but also for everybody living in the digital culture. Computer Science is still a young field. Although we have witnessed numerous advances in the past, this is only the beginning of a new revolution as the potential of information technology has not yet been fully realized. Information technology is in the midst of a revolution as we move from explicit interactions with disconnected computing devices to implicit and pervasive interactions with highly interconnected, integrated digital resources embedded in the environments in which we work, live, learn, and play. The impact of computer science and information engineering will be broad and deep. Computer Science programs at HKUST prepare students for exciting challenges and new opportunities that help to bring such impact to our lives. The Department offers a full range of courses to meet the needs of its own students and those from other departments. Its programs lead to the BEng, BSc, MSc, MPhil, and PhD degrees. Aside from taking computer science courses, students are encouraged to design individual study plans tailored to their own interests.

While they seem to be jargons to many, the related technologies are making impacts on how software changes the world. In highly competitive software markets, companies need to ship reliable software products that their clients can trust. As such, software quality is one of their top concerns. What if you are told that a bot will learn your program and write tests for you? What if you are further told that the bot will learn from test execution results and locate where the faults in your program reside? What if the bot can even fix the faults for you when you are crossing your fingers? CASTLE is research team led by Prof Shing-Chi Cheung to study the state-of-the-arts technologies on code analysis, testing and learning. Besides pursuing the advancement in automated test generation, fault localization and program repair, CASTLE is solving the challenging problem of automated program synthesis. Techniques developed are supported by tools that can be applied by users on their software applications. The following are the overviews of two CASTLE research projects that automatically locate program faults for enterprise and mobile applications by blending state-of-the-arts software engineering, big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Locating Crash-inducing Changes Software crashes are severe manifestation of software bugs that result in poor user experiences. To facilitate the diagnosis of crashing bugs, crash reporting systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows Error Reporting) have been deployed to collect crash reports automatically. Nevertheless, developers still require much manual effort in debugging crashes. Although there are many crash analysis techniques proposed to help diagnose crashes, we still have very limited understanding on existing crash diagnosis practice. CASTLE found that crash-inducing changes are one critical piece of debugging information and thereby proposed efficient techniques with support tools to automatically locate crash-inducing changes. Upon crash diagnosis, developers can integrate these tools into existing crash reporting systems, such as Microsoft Crash Reporting. The tools can be incorporated into products, deploying a crash reporting system. Taming Android Fragmentation Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it difficult for Android app developers to assure the compatibility of their software across these models and system versions. CASTLE developed analysis techniques and support tools to automatically mine and detect Android compatibility issues. The tools report actionable debugging information when it detects potential issues. Android app developers can deploy the tools to their code and detect potential incompatibility issues that may arise across device models and system versions. For each reported issue, app developers may validate the issue by running their app on the concerned device models or system versions. Android device vendors may also follow the methodology to address compatibility problems in their products arising from the fragmentation in their OS releases, library versions and hardware configurations.

It is a very important problem because it facilitates drivers by predicting road conditions, enhances flight safety by providing weather guidance for regional aviation, avoids casualties by issuing citywide rainfall alerts, among many possibilities. In addition to the inherent complexities of the atmosphere and relevant dynamical processes, the ever-growing need for real-time, large-scale, and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting poses extra challenges to the meteorological community and has aroused research interest in the machine learning community. A simplified version of the problem is illustrated below. After receiving a sequence of radar echo maps up to the current time step, the task is to predict the radar echo maps in the next few time steps based on which rainfall intensities in specific locations can be estimated. For example, the radar maps are taken from the weather radar every six minutes. Over the past few years, Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and his research students have collaborated with the Hong Kong Observatory to solve the precipitation nowcasting problem using weather radar data collected in Hong Kong since 2009. By formulating precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, they first proposed the ConvLSTM model [Shi et al., 2015] by incorporating convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Using the radar echo data collected in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2013 for model training, ConvLSTM gives more accurate predictions than the current algorithm used by the Hong Kong Observatory which is based on estimating the optical flow. Recently, the team proposed a more general model called TrajGRU [Shi et al, 2017] which extends ConvLSTM in several important dimensions. A major extension is that TrajGRU can actively learn the location-variant structure for the recurrent connections in the RNN model and hence can handle more natural motion and transformation such as rotation. Moreover, the dataset has been extended to cover seven years, from 2009 to 2015. Because of the further improvement in prediction accuracy, the Hong Kong Observatory is currently porting the TrajGRU implementation to their online system for more thorough testing. This collaborative project benefits both the academic researchers and the practitioners in that it has led to publications in a top machine learning conference as well as deliverables that are being incorporated into the operational system for real-world weather forecasting.

TITLE: Towards Understanding of Engagement in Human-Robot Interaction | HKUST CSE

One of the most straightforward and effective ways is through its eyes, i.e., the cameras. The HKUST HCI Initiative thus conducted a series of HRI research to equip robots with the ability to visually perceive human status on different scales, from eyes, faces and to body poses. In natural human-human interactions, people make eye contacts from time to time to deliver very rich information to each other, e.g., attention, interest, etc. HCI Initiative studied how to estimate the level of boredom/sleepiness - attentional engagement - of participants in real-time HRI by temporal modeling of typical eye-related movements, i.e., eyelid and eyeball motions. Compared to eyes, faces provide more fine-grained information of one's shifts of attentional engagement. For an interactive robot, it needs to constantly check whether participants are facing towards it and whether they are still engaged with current interactions. HCI Initiative proposed an approach to sense participants' engagement transitions by modeling the dynamics of their face orientations as well as other social signals. Through face modeling, a robot could effectively detect engagement changes when the participants get distracted by peripheral devices. In addition to attentional engagement, faces are also highly indicative of affective engagement in interactions. In order to be emotionally intelligent, a robot should also be sensitive to such status. Many studies have used facial movements to recognize the type of emotional expressions. However, even when the same affect is shown, its intensity may fluctuate over time. HCI Initiative intends to capture the largely overlooked intensity of emotional engagement from rich gesture and body posture expressions. Thus, a model to combine body poses and faces is developed to help a robot to "feel" the subtle emotional fluctuations of its human partners throughout their interaction. The model has been tested empirically and the robot appeared to be more sensitive to changes in human emotion and thus perceived to be more emotionally intelligent. Besides being able to infer human engagement, a robot should also ensure that its human partners can understand the robot itself. A robot is still far from embracing "humanness" in interactions if its movements or motions are unreadable and/or unpredictable for human beings. How can a robot effectively express its intents, its engagement or even its "smartness" via movements and motions so that it can be understood and trusted by human partners? To this end, HCI Initiative developed a set of rule-based robot action strategies. In one user study, a robot was designed to behave either explicitly or implicitly when trying to deliver its intents. For example, when the robot detects the engagement shifts of human beings, it would react with pauses in the implicit mode, or it would speak out directly in the explicit mode. Results show that the participants always appreciated when a robot could acknowledge their engagement shift. A second user study investigated how a robot should respond to its partner's affective fluctuations. The robot was equipped with two styles of emotional responses: it can react by speech only (verbal) or it can use speech together with expressive gestures/postures (verbal+). Results suggest that verbal responses are sufficient in some occasions while gesture/postures are more effective for robots to show empathy. By applying these reaction strategies, robots are more understandable in simple interaction scenarios. HCI Initiative is exploring more complex and interesting practical applications, by exploiting more rigorous mathematical modeling and more effective algorithms.

From daily mobile payment to personal healthcare monitoring, smart devices have penetrated into every part of our life. Along with the great convenience of smart devices, there also comes an increasing concern about their security issues, as the data involved is often extremely valuable and highly sensitive, gaining much attention from malicious attackers. Also, the limited computing resource, growing data transmission capability and expanding device-device connectivity have aggravated the security threats. As a result, securing the ecosystem of smart devices has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. Among the research pioneers is Prof. Qian Zhang, who envisioned many years ago that great potential and serious threats coexist in smart devices. One major research of Prof. Zhang's group in HKUST is to build reliable and robust securing systems for smart devices, including the following aspects: (1) User-device interaction defines how the user accesses the device. From the perspective of security design, Prof. Zhang's group focuses on recognizing who is using the smart device. Existing user identification solutions either rely on expensive hardware, e.g., fingerprints, or require complex modeling and large computation power. As both the computation and battery are scarce resources on many smart devices, existing solutions do not work well. To fill the gap, Prof. Zhang's group builds two light-weight user identification systems for power-constrained devices. One uses the underlying pattern hidden in the human gesture dynamics as an identifier while the other one leverages the bio-vibrometry, i.e., the vibration response of the human body, to differentiate various users. According to their comprehensive evaluations on the volunteers, both systems can provide identification accuracy above 91% in small-scale scenarios of limited users (e.g., home scenario) with minimal power requirement and are robust to various confounding factors. (2) Fueled by the close cooperation among smart devices, the device-device connection is prevalent and forming secure pairing between devices lays the foundations of the security protection and data privacy preservation. Prof. Zhang's group has devoted much effort in this field and successfully built several systems, each of which targets different scenarios and provides various security levels. Touch-And-Guard (TAG) is their first research outcome. It uses hand touch as an intuitive means to establish a secure connection between a wristband wearable and the touched device. Specifically, it generates secret bits from hand resonant properties and uses it to authenticate each other and then communicate confidentially. The evaluations on 12 volunteers indicate that TAG can serve as a natural and user-friendly pairing interface by generating secret bits at a rate of 7.84 bit/s, 58% faster than conventional text input PIN authentication. Apart from that, a proximity-based mechanism with a better security level, Move2Auth, is also proposed. In Move2Auth, a user only needs to hold the smartphone and perform random rotations in front of the IoT device. As the rotations lead to significant variations and fast changes in signal attenuation and antenna polarization, a secure and random key can be extracted from the Received Signal Strength (RSS). By matching the RSS-trace and motion data captured by the built-in motion sensors on the smartphone, Move2Auth can create a secure link between these devices and can protect against a powerful active attacker who can arbitrarily tune transmission power. To further boost the security level, the research group also explored the possibility of secure pairing based on human bio-metrics: the Electromyogram signal (EMG) caused by human muscle contraction. By exploring stochastic nature hidden in the EMG signal to generate secure bits, their work proves that the secure key generated from the EMG signal has sufficient randomness and security--even when the attacker can perfectly copy the user's gesture, the generated secure key cannot be stolen or cracked. Extensive evaluation on the volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that this system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a very high-security level. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrates that their system is very secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture, or even imitate the legitimate pairing process with the help of advanced computer-vision-based techniques. (3) In the context of device-environment sensing, Prof. Zhang and her group members have explored the possible security attacks caused by the continuous, unobtrusive, and unrestricted sensing ability of mobile devices. They first investigate how to prevent mobile-camera-based piracy attack on physical intellectual properties, such as painting and sculpture. To this end, a new lighting system, Rainbow, is invented to pollute the pirate photo/video on the mobile camera but retains a good visual quality for the human observer. By carefully modulating the chromatic change and luminance flicker into the light system, Rainbow introduces a non-uniform variation into the reflected light energy from physical objects, thus maximizing the distortion caused by the camera's banding effect. Meanwhile, due to the color fusion ability and low-band pass characteristics of human vision, the visual quality for the human observer is not affected. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios indicate that this lighting system is robust with different confounding factors and can significantly pollute the piracy photos on various devices. After that, another potential but serious information leakage attack is also exhibited by demonstrating how the attacker can unobtrusively track users in an indoor scenario. The key is to explore the nonlinearity characteristics of the ambient light sensor to sense the high-frequency modulated location information with a low sampling rate. In particular, due to the nonlinear characteristics of electronic components inside the circuit, the amplifier in ALS exhibits some levels of nonlinearity. When two high-frequency signals are received by the ALS simultaneously, such nonlinearity renders the output signal of the amplifier violate the linear superposition rule and generate a low-frequency "shadow" signal. In light of this idea, the research group has built a low-power and unobtrusive indoor localization system, NALoc. The experiments on ALS sensors from Apple and Samsung devices confirm the feasibility of such a system and extensive experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive the fine-grained location information unobtrusively from the ALS readings, which poses a brand-new security threat. Corresponding countermeasures are also discussed in their research paper.

Developed by a team led by Prof Gary Chan of the Department of the Computer Science and Engineering, the location sensing technology – a software suite which fuses Wi-Fi with other signals on mobile platforms – is the first of its kind deployed in Hong Kong. It could reduce the position error to less than 2.5 meters in general environment, three times more accurate than traditional approaches. To locate a person, the technology combines signals from multiple sources such as Wi-Fi, geomagnetic field, Bluetooth, video and accelerometer reading. It has been deployed in Harbour City at Tsim Sha Tsui, and is now under commercial trials in malls (in collaboration with New World Development Research and Development, PCCW Solutions, and Link) and hospitals. "Existing location-based technologies often draw signals from a single source. As different signals have different limitations, their accuracy is not so satisfactory and their application environment is not general enough," said Prof Chan, also Director of Entrepreneurship Center at HKUST. "Our technology is to fuse the signals to combine their strengths while overcoming their limitations. The higher location accuracy makes possible novel location-based services and facilitates Hong Kong's development as a smart city." The technology can also create synergy with the government's smart lamp posts pilot scheme announced earlier as an initiative of the Smart City Blueprint, which plans to install multifunctional smart lamp posts starting 2019 to facilitate collection of real-time city data in enhancing city management and other public services. Incorporated with the technology, the lamp posts will not only provide timely location-based services to tourists and general public, but will also create immense social value on helping to find missing people, pets and preventing them from getting lost. Funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission's Innovation and Technology Fund and managed by Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies (LSCM R&D Center), Prof Chan's technology is now being commercialized through two start-ups run by HKUST graduates. The fusion technology is based on fingerprinting. Survey is first conducted to collect the signals at different locations of a given site. Using machine learning, the signal's characteristics at these locations are analyzed and modeled. Upon detecting signals from a user, the location of the user can then be estimated accurately and efficiently. Patents of the technology have been filed in the US and mainland China.

We are looking for outstanding undergraduate students as well as graduate students with a Masters degree in Computer Science and related areas. According to the latest QS World University Rankings, HKUST is ranked the 32th globally, and our CSE department ranked the 26th worldwide in the Subject of Computer Science and Information Systems. Our department has produced pioneering work in several areas, including but not limited to, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data and knowledge management, human computer interaction, networks and distributed systems, software technologies, theoretical computer science and algorithms, and vision and graphics. Our department consists of over 50 faculty members, about 100 MPhil students and 280 PhD students. The MPhil study takes two years, and the PhD study four to five years. Many of our postgraduate alumni work at major IT companies such as Baidu, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, and Tencent, and a significant number of our PhD graduates pursue their careers at research institutes and universities all over the world. If interested, please check out the departmental web page on where do our PhD graduates go. Postgraduate students have sufficient scholarship support during their study at HKUST. The amount of scholarship is about HKD200,000 (USD25,500) per person per year. The School of Engineering selects excellent postgraduate students to award additional scholarship to cover the tuition. The annual tuition of a postgraduate student is HKD42,100 (USD5,300). Furthermore, the Hong Kong government selects incoming PhD students to award the prestigious Hong Kong PhD Fellowship (HKPF) each year. The amount of the HKPF is around HKD25,100 per month, plus a travel allowance of HKD12,600 each year. In addition, HKUST gives each awardee a one-time reward of HKD40,000. In the past, our department was awarded 8 to 10 HKPFs every year. Our postgraduate admissions require applicants to have good academic records in their areas of study and to have obtained a Bachelor's degree by the time of their HKUST enrollment. Applicants also need to satisfy the University English Language Requirements. We recruit postgraduate students in two phases. The first phase is early recruiting, targeted at excellent MPhil and PhD applicants through telephone or onsite interviews. To apply, you can fill out the preliminary application form (registration for early admission has closed) at the departmental early recruiting website. We will process these online applications and shortlist candidates to invite for on-site interviews. This year, the early admission interviews will start in September 2019. Applicants will be notified their interview results one to two weeks after their interviews. After the early recruiting phase, applicants can still send regular application packages to the HKUST Postgraduate Admissions. Finally, we encourage exceptional PhD applicants (top 10% in class, average grade higher than 85/100, excellent English) to contact us to inquire about the HKPF applications. Please find relevant information at the HKUST's HKPFS web site. If you have any questions, feel free to contact mmsend('pgrecruit'). FAQ Q1. I have not taken TOEFL/IELTS now, can I apply in this early recruit session? Yes. You are eligible to apply. However, if you are admitted, you should meet our departments' English requirements before enrollment. Q2. When is the deadline for early admission application? For full consideration, please submit your application by Aug 31 (Sep 30 Oct 7 for applicants to be interviewed in Seoul). Applications received after this date will be processed if quota is available. Q3. When and where is the interview? This year's interviews are scheduled as follows: Beijing (Aug 31), Shanghai (Sep 7), Shenzhen (Sep 14), and Seoul (Oct 19)* If you are shortlisted, you will be notified by email inviting you to one of the interviews. * For applicants to be interviewed in Seoul, applications by Sep 30 Oct 7 will receive full consideration. Q4. When will I get the offer? The first batch of offers will be made to exceptional applicants around Sep 21 (Oct 26 for applicants interviewed in Seoul). After the first batch, offers will be sent out on a continuous basis as soon as decisions are made, usually with the support from a prospective advisor. Q5. I have not received an offer in the first batch, should I contact individual faculty members? Mass emails to the faculty are unlikely to be effective (they receive many such emails). All your application materials will be made available to the faculty, so there is no need to send them again. Thus, if you would like to contact individual faculty members, please try to differentiate your email from hundreds of others: Why are you interested in his/her research? What qualities of yours make you a good student of his/hers? If you have read one of his/her papers, do you have some comments and further ideas? Read more about General Admission FAQ.
