This is one of the major challenges faced by today's e-learning platforms, particularly massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera and edX which have students from all over the world. A research team led by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung, with collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been developing advanced learning analytics tools to improve online education using machine learning technologies. As a project funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Government under the HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium, the approach adopted by the team is centered around the notion of personalization. The research mission is to significantly improve the learning effectiveness of e-learning platforms through personalization without having to pare down the massive scale and high learner-to-teacher ratio of the courses. Their personalized e-learning tools monitor the clickstream events of the learners for all the online activities, which include video lecture viewing, discussion forum participation, assignment submission, and quiz/exam performance. Based on the user profiles built and continuously updated, the learning performance of each learner is assessed and predicted with respect to a wide range of performance indicators using ensemble learning and temporal learning models which include recurrent neural network models. The goal is to identify the underperforming learners and their areas of underperformance and to help them improve using two other components of the system, the study plan generator and the AI tutor. Some of the predictive analytics tools that the team members have developed using machine learning techniques for temporal sequence data include predicting the grade distribution at the end of a course, analyzing the effect of each feature of the machine learning model on performance prediction, identifying learners and zooming into each of them to understand why there is a significant drop in the predicted performance within a short period of time, and providing recommendation on additional learning activities to make improvement with respect to various specific performance indicators. Based on similar machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, Prof. Yeung and two of his research team members recently participated in an international educational data mining competition, the 2017 ASSISTments Data Mining Competition. The dataset provided by the competition contains massive data for several hundred students, ranging from the detailed interaction data collected on the popular ASSISTments learning platform when they were middle school students, to career choice data of the students after they graduated from university. The goal was to use the ASSISTments interaction data to predict which students would, a few years later, enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate school programs and later STEM careers. Of the 74 teams of researchers participated in the competition, Prof. Yeung's team was awarded the first place. They developed a recurrent neural network model augmented with novel regularizers to address some problems encountered by existing knowledge tracing models to learn semantically meaningful features related to the knowledge states of different mathematical skills. They then made use of these learned features to augment the other static features extracted directly from the ASSISTments interaction data to boost the STEM prediction accuracy.

Developed by a team led by Prof Gary Chan of the Department of the Computer Science and Engineering, the location sensing technology – a software suite which fuses Wi-Fi with other signals on mobile platforms – is the first of its kind deployed in Hong Kong. It could reduce the position error to less than 2.5 meters in general environment, three times more accurate than traditional approaches. To locate a person, the technology combines signals from multiple sources such as Wi-Fi, geomagnetic field, Bluetooth, video and accelerometer reading. It has been deployed in Harbour City at Tsim Sha Tsui, and is now under commercial trials in malls (in collaboration with New World Development Research and Development, PCCW Solutions, and Link) and hospitals. "Existing location-based technologies often draw signals from a single source. As different signals have different limitations, their accuracy is not so satisfactory and their application environment is not general enough," said Prof Chan, also Director of Entrepreneurship Center at HKUST. "Our technology is to fuse the signals to combine their strengths while overcoming their limitations. The higher location accuracy makes possible novel location-based services and facilitates Hong Kong's development as a smart city." The technology can also create synergy with the government's smart lamp posts pilot scheme announced earlier as an initiative of the Smart City Blueprint, which plans to install multifunctional smart lamp posts starting 2019 to facilitate collection of real-time city data in enhancing city management and other public services. Incorporated with the technology, the lamp posts will not only provide timely location-based services to tourists and general public, but will also create immense social value on helping to find missing people, pets and preventing them from getting lost. Funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission's Innovation and Technology Fund and managed by Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies (LSCM R&D Center), Prof Chan's technology is now being commercialized through two start-ups run by HKUST graduates. The fusion technology is based on fingerprinting. Survey is first conducted to collect the signals at different locations of a given site. Using machine learning, the signal's characteristics at these locations are analyzed and modeled. Upon detecting signals from a user, the location of the user can then be estimated accurately and efficiently. Patents of the technology have been filed in the US and mainland China.

TITLE: Towards Understanding of Engagement in Human-Robot Interaction | HKUST CSE

One of the most straightforward and effective ways is through its eyes, i.e., the cameras. The HKUST HCI Initiative thus conducted a series of HRI research to equip robots with the ability to visually perceive human status on different scales, from eyes, faces and to body poses. In natural human-human interactions, people make eye contacts from time to time to deliver very rich information to each other, e.g., attention, interest, etc. HCI Initiative studied how to estimate the level of boredom/sleepiness - attentional engagement - of participants in real-time HRI by temporal modeling of typical eye-related movements, i.e., eyelid and eyeball motions. Compared to eyes, faces provide more fine-grained information of one's shifts of attentional engagement. For an interactive robot, it needs to constantly check whether participants are facing towards it and whether they are still engaged with current interactions. HCI Initiative proposed an approach to sense participants' engagement transitions by modeling the dynamics of their face orientations as well as other social signals. Through face modeling, a robot could effectively detect engagement changes when the participants get distracted by peripheral devices. In addition to attentional engagement, faces are also highly indicative of affective engagement in interactions. In order to be emotionally intelligent, a robot should also be sensitive to such status. Many studies have used facial movements to recognize the type of emotional expressions. However, even when the same affect is shown, its intensity may fluctuate over time. HCI Initiative intends to capture the largely overlooked intensity of emotional engagement from rich gesture and body posture expressions. Thus, a model to combine body poses and faces is developed to help a robot to "feel" the subtle emotional fluctuations of its human partners throughout their interaction. The model has been tested empirically and the robot appeared to be more sensitive to changes in human emotion and thus perceived to be more emotionally intelligent. Besides being able to infer human engagement, a robot should also ensure that its human partners can understand the robot itself. A robot is still far from embracing "humanness" in interactions if its movements or motions are unreadable and/or unpredictable for human beings. How can a robot effectively express its intents, its engagement or even its "smartness" via movements and motions so that it can be understood and trusted by human partners? To this end, HCI Initiative developed a set of rule-based robot action strategies. In one user study, a robot was designed to behave either explicitly or implicitly when trying to deliver its intents. For example, when the robot detects the engagement shifts of human beings, it would react with pauses in the implicit mode, or it would speak out directly in the explicit mode. Results show that the participants always appreciated when a robot could acknowledge their engagement shift. A second user study investigated how a robot should respond to its partner's affective fluctuations. The robot was equipped with two styles of emotional responses: it can react by speech only (verbal) or it can use speech together with expressive gestures/postures (verbal+). Results suggest that verbal responses are sufficient in some occasions while gesture/postures are more effective for robots to show empathy. By applying these reaction strategies, robots are more understandable in simple interaction scenarios. HCI Initiative is exploring more complex and interesting practical applications, by exploiting more rigorous mathematical modeling and more effective algorithms.

The Robo-lawyer is an AI-based real system geared towards the masses. Its primary task is to sort out essential matters for drafting the agreement from user's input of several questions. The user can retrieve an agreement only if he/she can answer all questions, showing that they have thoroughly considered all the matters of concerns. The Robo-lawyer system has many applications in different domains. The current system supports divorce and employment contracts. For example, Hong Kong's divorce rate in 2016 was more than double that in 1991. The rising demand for family mediation has been a mounting challenge for lawyers. Few divorcing couples actually realized that the high legal costs and procedural drag would take an emotional toll on themselves. Many of them are unwilling or unable to sit down for a mediation that could take months or years, especially for cross-border couples. A chatbot specialized in generating divorce agreements contracts can help them get through the process easier. To make the Robo-lawyer more like a real person, sentiment analysis has been employed to help identify true feelings and moods of a person heading to a divorce through the dialogue. When a user writes "I am glad", for instance, it should be interpreted as an expression of relief instead of being upbeat. It even makes effort to persuade couples to think twice before finally deciding to divorce. Watch a demo of the current system. This is a collaborative project with Albert SO, a CSE alumnus from HKUST, who chairs the Hong Kong Mediation and Arbitration Centre.

TITLE: Securing the Smart Devices | HKUST CSE

From daily mobile payment to personal healthcare monitoring, smart devices have penetrated into every part of our life. Along with the great convenience of smart devices, there also comes an increasing concern about their security issues, as the data involved is often extremely valuable and highly sensitive, gaining much attention from malicious attackers. Also, the limited computing resource, growing data transmission capability and expanding device-device connectivity have aggravated the security threats. As a result, securing the ecosystem of smart devices has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. Among the research pioneers is Prof. Qian Zhang, who envisioned many years ago that great potential and serious threats coexist in smart devices. One major research of Prof. Zhang's group in HKUST is to build reliable and robust securing systems for smart devices, including the following aspects: (1) User-device interaction defines how the user accesses the device. From the perspective of security design, Prof. Zhang's group focuses on recognizing who is using the smart device. Existing user identification solutions either rely on expensive hardware, e.g., fingerprints, or require complex modeling and large computation power. As both the computation and battery are scarce resources on many smart devices, existing solutions do not work well. To fill the gap, Prof. Zhang's group builds two light-weight user identification systems for power-constrained devices. One uses the underlying pattern hidden in the human gesture dynamics as an identifier while the other one leverages the bio-vibrometry, i.e., the vibration response of the human body, to differentiate various users. According to their comprehensive evaluations on the volunteers, both systems can provide identification accuracy above 91% in small-scale scenarios of limited users (e.g., home scenario) with minimal power requirement and are robust to various confounding factors. (2) Fueled by the close cooperation among smart devices, the device-device connection is prevalent and forming secure pairing between devices lays the foundations of the security protection and data privacy preservation. Prof. Zhang's group has devoted much effort in this field and successfully built several systems, each of which targets different scenarios and provides various security levels. Touch-And-Guard (TAG) is their first research outcome. It uses hand touch as an intuitive means to establish a secure connection between a wristband wearable and the touched device. Specifically, it generates secret bits from hand resonant properties and uses it to authenticate each other and then communicate confidentially. The evaluations on 12 volunteers indicate that TAG can serve as a natural and user-friendly pairing interface by generating secret bits at a rate of 7.84 bit/s, 58% faster than conventional text input PIN authentication. Apart from that, a proximity-based mechanism with a better security level, Move2Auth, is also proposed. In Move2Auth, a user only needs to hold the smartphone and perform random rotations in front of the IoT device. As the rotations lead to significant variations and fast changes in signal attenuation and antenna polarization, a secure and random key can be extracted from the Received Signal Strength (RSS). By matching the RSS-trace and motion data captured by the built-in motion sensors on the smartphone, Move2Auth can create a secure link between these devices and can protect against a powerful active attacker who can arbitrarily tune transmission power. To further boost the security level, the research group also explored the possibility of secure pairing based on human bio-metrics: the Electromyogram signal (EMG) caused by human muscle contraction. By exploring stochastic nature hidden in the EMG signal to generate secure bits, their work proves that the secure key generated from the EMG signal has sufficient randomness and security--even when the attacker can perfectly copy the user's gesture, the generated secure key cannot be stolen or cracked. Extensive evaluation on the volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that this system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a very high-security level. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrates that their system is very secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture, or even imitate the legitimate pairing process with the help of advanced computer-vision-based techniques. (3) In the context of device-environment sensing, Prof. Zhang and her group members have explored the possible security attacks caused by the continuous, unobtrusive, and unrestricted sensing ability of mobile devices. They first investigate how to prevent mobile-camera-based piracy attack on physical intellectual properties, such as painting and sculpture. To this end, a new lighting system, Rainbow, is invented to pollute the pirate photo/video on the mobile camera but retains a good visual quality for the human observer. By carefully modulating the chromatic change and luminance flicker into the light system, Rainbow introduces a non-uniform variation into the reflected light energy from physical objects, thus maximizing the distortion caused by the camera's banding effect. Meanwhile, due to the color fusion ability and low-band pass characteristics of human vision, the visual quality for the human observer is not affected. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios indicate that this lighting system is robust with different confounding factors and can significantly pollute the piracy photos on various devices. After that, another potential but serious information leakage attack is also exhibited by demonstrating how the attacker can unobtrusively track users in an indoor scenario. The key is to explore the nonlinearity characteristics of the ambient light sensor to sense the high-frequency modulated location information with a low sampling rate. In particular, due to the nonlinear characteristics of electronic components inside the circuit, the amplifier in ALS exhibits some levels of nonlinearity. When two high-frequency signals are received by the ALS simultaneously, such nonlinearity renders the output signal of the amplifier violate the linear superposition rule and generate a low-frequency "shadow" signal. In light of this idea, the research group has built a low-power and unobtrusive indoor localization system, NALoc. The experiments on ALS sensors from Apple and Samsung devices confirm the feasibility of such a system and extensive experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive the fine-grained location information unobtrusively from the ALS readings, which poses a brand-new security threat. Corresponding countermeasures are also discussed in their research paper.

This is precisely the work being prototyped by PhD student Bing Yen CHANG and Prof. Andrew Horner in the Computer Music group. Listeners can direct where the music goes emotionally like a Movie Director guides how the composer develops the score. It is a new form of active listening! Listeners can take their favorite music to places it has never gone before, but could! They can bring out different emotional potential of the music - even some that may be deeply hidden in the music. For example, imagine Canon in D, but with an Angry tone - rendered in harmonic minor with a menacing quality like Phantom of the Opera or The Empire Strikes Back. Or, perhaps Tragic like a funeral march, or Lively like a Celtic folk dance on Irish flute, or Tenderly-Romantic like a love ballad. You don't have to imagine anymore, check it out: Canon in D. Every piece of music can be shaded or shaped to bring out the full range of emotional characteristics, in a similar way that Monet's Rouen Cathedral appears in dozens of different characters depending on the light and color (i.e., time of day, weather, lighting, shadows). He uses the same subject, the same viewpoint, the same style, but the different lighting and colors produce different moods. Paintings from Monet's Rouen Cathedral series. How can we similarly "shade" or "color" music so that is has different mood or emotional characteristics? The three main musical parameters for excitement level are pitch register (i.e., which octave), tempo, dynamics. We see this in real-life in over-excited trumpet players, who always want to play higher, faster, and louder! For the mood of the music (how positive or negative it is), the main musical factors are the particular mode of the music (e.g., major or minor), to a lesser extent the overall pitch range (high or low), and other melodic and harmonic aspects. In the near future, imagine bringing to life your own Carmen! Though your control of the music, play the matador Escamilla in the bullfight scene, and guide the music to parry the charges of a furious bull in the dusty ring while the screaming crowd cheers and gasps. Or, guide Carmen's dance that mesmerizes the carousing soldiers in the opening Habanera scene. Or, through your own emotional twists in the music, play Carmen in the final tragic encounter with her jealous former lover Don Jose outside the bullfight stadium with defiant bravado. What happens if Carmen successfully fights back? Or, what if she escapes to the bullring, facing off with Don Jose, Escamilla, and the bull, writing a new ending to the opera, with your version of the music telling the tale!

Bugs in our programs such as the Heartbleed (2014) and WannaCry (2017) cost billions of dollars to fix and generate drastic social impacts. A key reason is that modern software vulnerability detection technology does not catch up with the size and the complexity of real world software system. To scale, these techniques typically relax the scanning strength, producing a lot of noise in the results, or restrict the scope, missing critical issues. Both compromises render software systems to eminent threats. Pinpoint is a new technique, designed by Prof. Charles Zhang and his research team in the Cybersecurity Laboratory, leveraging clever designs in static analysis, a methodology for predicting software behaviour through logic deduction, to discover dangerous vulnerabilities in large modern software systems. Pinpoint takes a "holistic" approach in combining the analysis of lower level memory behaviour of software systems together with the high level detection of logic errors and, thus, dramatically reducing the amount of computation. The following diagram illustrates the basic operation of Pinpoint. It is capable of detecting over 40 types of different software vulnerabilities in system as large as eight millions of lines of code within a few hours. It has discovered over 80 confirmed issues in high quality open source systems such as MySQL and Firefox. Pinpoint is also being used by world leading technical firms such as Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei. You can use Pinpoint either through the Pinpoint Online Scan or download a special PLDI desktop version, commemorating the publishing of its core technology in ACM SIGPLAN PLDI conference in 2018.

Covering topics in the areas of foundations of computer science and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, networking, computer graphics, multimedia computing, software and web technologies, and data and knowledge-base systems, the Computer Science programs at this University are dedicated to educate students and to advance research in computer and information technology; as well as to assist in the development and growth of the information industry in the region. Through the efforts of researchers and engineers, computers have evolved from large, slow, expensive, and very specialized systems to small, fast, affordable, and ordinary tools that are part of virtually everyone's life. Advances in networking technologies and human-computer interfacing technologies have further created a digital culture. The ubiquitous nature of computers in today's workplace and home environment is making computer literacy a requirement not only for all professionals in industrial societies but also for everybody living in the digital culture. Computer Science is still a young field. Although we have witnessed numerous advances in the past, this is only the beginning of a new revolution as the potential of information technology has not yet been fully realized. Information technology is in the midst of a revolution as we move from explicit interactions with disconnected computing devices to implicit and pervasive interactions with highly interconnected, integrated digital resources embedded in the environments in which we work, live, learn, and play. The impact of computer science and information engineering will be broad and deep. Computer Science programs at HKUST prepare students for exciting challenges and new opportunities that help to bring such impact to our lives. The Department offers a full range of courses to meet the needs of its own students and those from other departments. Its programs lead to the BEng, BSc, MSc, MPhil, and PhD degrees. Aside from taking computer science courses, students are encouraged to design individual study plans tailored to their own interests.

Ranked No. 26 in Computer Science and Information Systems according to the QS World University Rankings 2019 Features of our programs include: special honors courses, independent study and undergraduate research opportunities for elite students; American-style teaching; intensive English training; optional one-year exchange; final-year projects; ample scholarships and awards; optional one-year full-time internship; and industrial training. More details on the Distinguishing Features and Highlights. All undergraduate admissions are handled by the HKUST Undergraduate Admissions. For more information about the undergraduate majors in Computer Science, please visit our Undergraduate Programs. Students are initially admitted to the School of Engineering and declare their intended major at the end of the first year. The University and our Department offer students a number of scholarships, with each scholarship typically ranging from HK$10,000 to HK$40,000. Each entrant is automatically considered for such scholarships. Most scholarships are awarded to students based on their academic merits and the Department's recommendations. Distinguishing Features and Highlights HKUST CSE enabled me to explore areas via its flexible curriculum and UG research projects. I have thoroughly enjoyed enriching myself outside the classroom via academic exchange, student ambassadorship and internships.

The annual tuition of a postgraduate student is HKD42,100 (USD5,300). Furthermore, the Hong Kong government selects incoming PhD students to award the prestigious Hong Kong PhD Fellowship (HKPF) each year. The amount of the HKPF is around HKD25,100 per month, plus a travel allowance of HKD12,600 each year. In addition, HKUST gives each awardee a one-time reward of HKD40,000. In the past, our department was awarded 8 to 10 HKPFs every year. Our postgraduate admissions require applicants to have good academic records in their areas of study and to have obtained a Bachelor's degree by the time of their HKUST enrollment. Applicants also need to satisfy the University English Language Requirements. We recruit postgraduate students in two phases. The first phase is early recruiting, targeted at excellent MPhil and PhD applicants through telephone or onsite interviews. To apply, you can fill out the preliminary application form (registration for early admission has closed) at the departmental early recruiting website. We will process these online applications and shortlist candidates to invite for on-site interviews. This year, the early admission interviews will start in September 2019. Applicants will be notified their interview results one to two weeks after their interviews. After the early recruiting phase, applicants can still send regular application packages to the HKUST Postgraduate Admissions. Finally, we encourage exceptional PhD applicants (top 10% in class, average grade higher than 85/100, excellent English) to contact us to inquire about the HKPF applications. Please find relevant information at the HKUST's HKPFS web site. If you have any questions, feel free to contact mmsend('pgrecruit'). FAQ Q1. I have not taken TOEFL/IELTS now, can I apply in this early recruit session? Yes. You are eligible to apply. However, if you are admitted, you should meet our departments' English requirements before enrollment. Q2. When is the deadline for early admission application? For full consideration, please submit your application by Aug 31 (Sep 30 Oct 7 for applicants to be interviewed in Seoul). Applications received after this date will be processed if quota is available. Q3. When and where is the interview? This year's interviews are scheduled as follows: Beijing (Aug 31), Shanghai (Sep 7), Shenzhen (Sep 14), and Seoul (Oct 19)* If you are shortlisted, you will be notified by email inviting you to one of the interviews. * For applicants to be interviewed in Seoul, applications by Sep 30 Oct 7 will receive full consideration. Q4. When will I get the offer? The first batch of offers will be made to exceptional applicants around Sep 21 (Oct 26 for applicants interviewed in Seoul). After the first batch, offers will be sent out on a continuous basis as soon as decisions are made, usually with the support from a prospective advisor. Q5. I have not received an offer in the first batch, should I contact individual faculty members? Mass emails to the faculty are unlikely to be effective (they receive many such emails). All your application materials will be made available to the faculty, so there is no need to send them again. Thus, if you would like to contact individual faculty members, please try to differentiate your email from hundreds of others: Why are you interested in his/her research? What qualities of yours make you a good student of his/hers? If you have read one of his/her papers, do you have some comments and further ideas? Read more about General Admission FAQ.

On this web site, you can find the topics that we have worked on and the papers that we have published. You can see our most cited (according to Scopus and Web of Science) and most recent work on each topic, and how our efforts on the topics evolve with time. Please proceed to the web site by clicking on the following picture. HKUST-CSE Publications Panorama The web site is created automatically based on the collection of publications by our faculty members and students that is kept at the HKUST Institutional Repository. The key technology behind it is a hierarchical topic detection method named hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA). HLTA is developed by a research team led by Prof. Nevin L. Zhang and the software package is kept at GitHub: https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta. HLTA first learns a latent variable probabilistic graphical model based on word co-occurrences, then builds a topic tree from the model, and finally uses the tree to index the documents. Here is a part of the structure of the model learned from a collection of articles published in The New York Times. In the era of big data, people are often confronted with large collections of unstructured text documents. Gaining an overview of the contents is important to the realization the potential values of such data. However, this is a difficult task. HLTA is developed to meet this challenge. It has been previously applied on research papers published in recent year at top AI and Machine Learning venues. The results are shown at aipano.cse.ust.hk to help researchers track research trends and identify papers to read, and help conference organizers and journal editors identify reviewers for submissions.

There exist many different ways of helping a user to solve this problem. One is an interactive approach which asks the user a number of questions (e.g., presenting two records and asking the user to choose a more preferable record) and then learns the user's preference automatically. Another is a log-oriented approach which analyzes the user's log data recorded by the system and learns the user's preferences via some data mining and deep learning approaches. After a user's preference is found, his/her favorite record can be easily determined. The following figure shows a scenario of our interactive approach. Consider that a user would like to find his/her favorite car. After asking the user about 5-7 questions, our system is able to know the user's preference and find his/her favorite car. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods in the literature of machine learning and database require asking the user about four times as many questions as in our system, which is tedious for the user. The figure below shows the user interface of our demo system that helps a user find his/her favorite car. Consider the log-oriented approach. Whenever a user visits a website, all activities of the user can be tracked. We proposed to use a recurrent neural network-based approach to model a user's preference in order to find the record that s/he is interested in. Our experimental result shows that the accuracy of our proposed approach is better than the best-known result. Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong has led a research team working on this project. Details about this project can be found in the following publications: Tianwen Chen and Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, "Session-based Recommendation with Local Invariance", the 19th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2019), Beijing, China on November 8-11, 2019 Min Xie, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, and Ashwin Lall, "Strongly Truthful Interactive Regret Minimization", the 2019 ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), Amsterdam, The Netherlands on 30 June-5 July, 2019 Min Xie, Tianwen Chen and Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, "FindYourFavorite: An Interactive System for Finding the User's Favorite Tuple in the Database", the 2019 ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), Amsterdam, The Netherlands on 30 June-5 July, 2019 (Demonstration Paper) More Research Projects Navigation Navigation About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements Last updated on 2019-08-19 Privacy Sitemap Copyright © The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The research by Prof. Qifeng Chen shows that an AI program can successfully render fictional novel scenes based on human input. As shown in the first figure, the deep learning model called the cascaded refinement network is able to generate photographic images based on semantic layouts. Learning-based image synthesis is connected to central problems in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, consider the problem of photorealism in computer graphics. A system that synthesizes photorealistic images from semantic layouts would in effect function as a kind of rendering engine that bypasses the laborious specification of detailed three-dimensional geometry and surface reflectance distributions, and avoids computationally intensive light transport simulation. Another source of motivation is the role of mental imagery and simulation in human cognition. Mental imagery is believed to play an important role in planning and decision making. The level of detail and completeness of mental imagery is a matter of debate, but its role in human intelligence suggests that the ability to synthesize photorealistic images may support the development of artificial intelligent systems. More recently, the research of Qifeng studies a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The second figure shows the image synthesis results by the semi-parametric approach. This approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material.
