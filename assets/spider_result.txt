While they seem to be jargons to many, the related technologies are making impacts on how software changes the world. In highly competitive software markets, companies need to ship reliable software products that their clients can trust. As such, software quality is one of their top concerns. What if you are told that a bot will learn your program and write tests for you? What if you are further told that the bot will learn from test execution results and locate where the faults in your program reside? What if the bot can even fix the faults for you when you are crossing your fingers? CASTLE is research team led by Prof Shing-Chi Cheung to study the state-of-the-arts technologies on code analysis, testing and learning. Besides pursuing the advancement in automated test generation, fault localization and program repair, CASTLE is solving the challenging problem of automated program synthesis. Techniques developed are supported by tools that can be applied by users on their software applications. The following are the overviews of two CASTLE research projects that automatically locate program faults for enterprise and mobile applications by blending state-of-the-arts software engineering, big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Locating Crash-inducing Changes Software crashes are severe manifestation of software bugs that result in poor user experiences. To facilitate the diagnosis of crashing bugs, crash reporting systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows Error Reporting) have been deployed to collect crash reports automatically. Nevertheless, developers still require much manual effort in debugging crashes. Although there are many crash analysis techniques proposed to help diagnose crashes, we still have very limited understanding on existing crash diagnosis practice. CASTLE found that crash-inducing changes are one critical piece of debugging information and thereby proposed efficient techniques with support tools to automatically locate crash-inducing changes. Upon crash diagnosis, developers can integrate these tools into existing crash reporting systems, such as Microsoft Crash Reporting. The tools can be incorporated into products, deploying a crash reporting system. Taming Android Fragmentation Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it difficult for Android app developers to assure the compatibility of their software across these models and system versions. CASTLE developed analysis techniques and support tools to automatically mine and detect Android compatibility issues. The tools report actionable debugging information when it detects potential issues. Android app developers can deploy the tools to their code and detect potential incompatibility issues that may arise across device models and system versions. For each reported issue, app developers may validate the issue by running their app on the concerned device models or system versions. Android device vendors may also follow the methodology to address compatibility problems in their products arising from the fragmentation in their OS releases, library versions and hardware configurations.

Bugs in our programs such as the Heartbleed (2014) and WannaCry (2017) cost billions of dollars to fix and generate drastic social impacts. A key reason is that modern software vulnerability detection technology does not catch up with the size and the complexity of real world software system. To scale, these techniques typically relax the scanning strength, producing a lot of noise in the results, or restrict the scope, missing critical issues. Both compromises render software systems to eminent threats. Pinpoint is a new technique, designed by Prof. Charles Zhang and his research team in the Cybersecurity Laboratory, leveraging clever designs in static analysis, a methodology for predicting software behaviour through logic deduction, to discover dangerous vulnerabilities in large modern software systems. Pinpoint takes a "holistic" approach in combining the analysis of lower level memory behaviour of software systems together with the high level detection of logic errors and, thus, dramatically reducing the amount of computation. The following diagram illustrates the basic operation of Pinpoint. It is capable of detecting over 40 types of different software vulnerabilities in system as large as eight millions of lines of code within a few hours. It has discovered over 80 confirmed issues in high quality open source systems such as MySQL and Firefox. Pinpoint is also being used by world leading technical firms such as Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei. You can use Pinpoint either through the Pinpoint Online Scan or download a special PLDI desktop version, commemorating the publishing of its core technology in ACM SIGPLAN PLDI conference in 2018.

TITLE: CODA: Facilitating Big Data Applications via Network Optimization | HKUST CSE

In an unprecedented era of big data, and with the rapid rise of cloud computing, scale-out big data applications running on large clusters are becoming the norm. However, as cluster and data scale grow, so does the execution time; discovering the potential of scaling big data applications requires developing novel techniques to keep the execution time manageable. In particular, communication is crucial for analytics at scale. Many of the big data applications are communication-intensive. Given the huge amount of data that needs to be synchronized among tens to thousands of workers, the communication stage can be the bottleneck that greatly affects the execution time. As a result, network system design has embraced new challenges and opportunities. The data center system platform in SING Lab HKUST After joining HKUST in 2012, Prof. Kai Chen has devoted himself to network systems design and implementation. For Kai and his SING Lab, one major theme of research is to provide efficient and intelligent networking support for big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, his group has implemented a 100+ node data center platform. As one of the many cutting-edge research projects done on top of the platform, the CODA system serves as a necessary and natural step towards practical network optimization for data-parallel applications. Traditional approaches toward improving network-level metrics are often misaligned with the goals of data-parallel applications. Although a data-parallel application treats all the flows in each communication stage (e.g., shuffle or broadcast) as a whole, the network treats each flow independently. To bridge this gap, the Coflow abstraction was proposed in 2012 to enable the network to realign its objectives with that of the applications. Since then, people have been working hard to make it practical. Throughout all their efforts, one requirement remained constant: all distributed data-parallel applications had to be modified to use the same Coflow API. Unfortunately, this is hard to do, because of the sheer number of computing frameworks available today. CODA makes a first attempt at addressing this problem head on. The intuition is simple: if we can automatically identify coflows from the network, applications need not be modified. There are at least two key challenges in achieving this goal. The first one is classifying coflows. Note that the identification must be application-transparent, i.e., involve no application modification. Unfortunately, unlike traditional traffic classification, coflows cannot be identified using five-tuples. The second challenge is avoiding the impact of misclassification, because even the best classifier will sometimes be wrong. To that end, the scheduling should be error-tolerant, i.e., it must be able to schedule coflows even when some flows have been misclassified. CODA Architecture CODA is a joint design to address these two challenges. For application-transparent coflow classification, CODA leverages domain-specific insights and simple machine learning techniques to capture the logical relationship between multiple flows. Furthermore, an incremental clustering algorithm is developed to provide fast identification with high accuracy. For error-tolerant coflow scheduling, a key design of late binding is proposed. By delaying the assignment of flows to particular coflows, CODA always errs on the side of caution and effectively minimizes the impact of identification errors. Testbed experiments and large-scale simulations with realistic production workloads showed that CODA can identify coflows with more than 90% accuracy and its scheduler is robust to inaccuracies. Overall, CODA's performance is comparable to that of solutions requiring application-level modifications, and significantly outperforms flow-based solutions. CODA appeared in SIGCOMM 2016, the flagship conference of ACM on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication, widely recognized as one of the most challenging CS conferences. This is the first time for SIGCOMM to have home-grown papers from Hong Kong universities.

Advances in networking technologies and human-computer interfacing technologies have further created a digital culture. The ubiquitous nature of computers in today's workplace and home environment is making computer literacy a requirement not only for all professionals in industrial societies but also for everybody living in the digital culture. Computer Science is still a young field. Although we have witnessed numerous advances in the past, this is only the beginning of a new revolution as the potential of information technology has not yet been fully realized. Information technology is in the midst of a revolution as we move from explicit interactions with disconnected computing devices to implicit and pervasive interactions with highly interconnected, integrated digital resources embedded in the environments in which we work, live, learn, and play. The impact of computer science and information engineering will be broad and deep. Computer Science programs at HKUST prepare students for exciting challenges and new opportunities that help to bring such impact to our lives. The Department offers a full range of courses to meet the needs of its own students and those from other departments. Its programs lead to the BEng, BSc, MSc, MPhil, and PhD degrees. Aside from taking computer science courses, students are encouraged to design individual study plans tailored to their own interests.

On this web site, you can find the topics that we have worked on and the papers that we have published. You can see our most cited (according to Scopus and Web of Science) and most recent work on each topic, and how our efforts on the topics evolve with time. Please proceed to the web site by clicking on the following picture. HKUST-CSE Publications Panorama The web site is created automatically based on the collection of publications by our faculty members and students that is kept at the HKUST Institutional Repository. The key technology behind it is a hierarchical topic detection method named hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA). HLTA is developed by a research team led by Prof. Nevin L. Zhang and the software package is kept at GitHub: https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta. HLTA first learns a latent variable probabilistic graphical model based on word co-occurrences, then builds a topic tree from the model, and finally uses the tree to index the documents. Here is a part of the structure of the model learned from a collection of articles published in The New York Times. In the era of big data, people are often confronted with large collections of unstructured text documents. Gaining an overview of the contents is important to the realization the potential values of such data. However, this is a difficult task. HLTA is developed to meet this challenge. It has been previously applied on research papers published in recent year at top AI and Machine Learning venues. The results are shown at aipano.cse.ust.hk to help researchers track research trends and identify papers to read, and help conference organizers and journal editors identify reviewers for submissions.

TITLE: Securing the Smart Devices | HKUST CSE

From daily mobile payment to personal healthcare monitoring, smart devices have penetrated into every part of our life. Along with the great convenience of smart devices, there also comes an increasing concern about their security issues, as the data involved is often extremely valuable and highly sensitive, gaining much attention from malicious attackers. Also, the limited computing resource, growing data transmission capability and expanding device-device connectivity have aggravated the security threats. As a result, securing the ecosystem of smart devices has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. Among the research pioneers is Prof. Qian Zhang, who envisioned many years ago that great potential and serious threats coexist in smart devices. One major research of Prof. Zhang's group in HKUST is to build reliable and robust securing systems for smart devices, including the following aspects: (1) User-device interaction defines how the user accesses the device. From the perspective of security design, Prof. Zhang's group focuses on recognizing who is using the smart device. Existing user identification solutions either rely on expensive hardware, e.g., fingerprints, or require complex modeling and large computation power. As both the computation and battery are scarce resources on many smart devices, existing solutions do not work well. To fill the gap, Prof. Zhang's group builds two light-weight user identification systems for power-constrained devices. One uses the underlying pattern hidden in the human gesture dynamics as an identifier while the other one leverages the bio-vibrometry, i.e., the vibration response of the human body, to differentiate various users. According to their comprehensive evaluations on the volunteers, both systems can provide identification accuracy above 91% in small-scale scenarios of limited users (e.g., home scenario) with minimal power requirement and are robust to various confounding factors. (2) Fueled by the close cooperation among smart devices, the device-device connection is prevalent and forming secure pairing between devices lays the foundations of the security protection and data privacy preservation. Prof. Zhang's group has devoted much effort in this field and successfully built several systems, each of which targets different scenarios and provides various security levels. Touch-And-Guard (TAG) is their first research outcome. It uses hand touch as an intuitive means to establish a secure connection between a wristband wearable and the touched device. Specifically, it generates secret bits from hand resonant properties and uses it to authenticate each other and then communicate confidentially. The evaluations on 12 volunteers indicate that TAG can serve as a natural and user-friendly pairing interface by generating secret bits at a rate of 7.84 bit/s, 58% faster than conventional text input PIN authentication. Apart from that, a proximity-based mechanism with a better security level, Move2Auth, is also proposed. In Move2Auth, a user only needs to hold the smartphone and perform random rotations in front of the IoT device. As the rotations lead to significant variations and fast changes in signal attenuation and antenna polarization, a secure and random key can be extracted from the Received Signal Strength (RSS). By matching the RSS-trace and motion data captured by the built-in motion sensors on the smartphone, Move2Auth can create a secure link between these devices and can protect against a powerful active attacker who can arbitrarily tune transmission power. To further boost the security level, the research group also explored the possibility of secure pairing based on human bio-metrics: the Electromyogram signal (EMG) caused by human muscle contraction. By exploring stochastic nature hidden in the EMG signal to generate secure bits, their work proves that the secure key generated from the EMG signal has sufficient randomness and security--even when the attacker can perfectly copy the user's gesture, the generated secure key cannot be stolen or cracked. Extensive evaluation on the volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that this system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a very high-security level. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrates that their system is very secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture, or even imitate the legitimate pairing process with the help of advanced computer-vision-based techniques. (3) In the context of device-environment sensing, Prof. Zhang and her group members have explored the possible security attacks caused by the continuous, unobtrusive, and unrestricted sensing ability of mobile devices. They first investigate how to prevent mobile-camera-based piracy attack on physical intellectual properties, such as painting and sculpture. To this end, a new lighting system, Rainbow, is invented to pollute the pirate photo/video on the mobile camera but retains a good visual quality for the human observer. By carefully modulating the chromatic change and luminance flicker into the light system, Rainbow introduces a non-uniform variation into the reflected light energy from physical objects, thus maximizing the distortion caused by the camera's banding effect. Meanwhile, due to the color fusion ability and low-band pass characteristics of human vision, the visual quality for the human observer is not affected. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios indicate that this lighting system is robust with different confounding factors and can significantly pollute the piracy photos on various devices. After that, another potential but serious information leakage attack is also exhibited by demonstrating how the attacker can unobtrusively track users in an indoor scenario. The key is to explore the nonlinearity characteristics of the ambient light sensor to sense the high-frequency modulated location information with a low sampling rate. In particular, due to the nonlinear characteristics of electronic components inside the circuit, the amplifier in ALS exhibits some levels of nonlinearity. When two high-frequency signals are received by the ALS simultaneously, such nonlinearity renders the output signal of the amplifier violate the linear superposition rule and generate a low-frequency "shadow" signal. In light of this idea, the research group has built a low-power and unobtrusive indoor localization system, NALoc. The experiments on ALS sensors from Apple and Samsung devices confirm the feasibility of such a system and extensive experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive the fine-grained location information unobtrusively from the ALS readings, which poses a brand-new security threat. Corresponding countermeasures are also discussed in their research paper.

These are the criteria that count for data analysts and business users who need to perform analytical queries on a large amount of data with complex conditions and return aggregated results that can enable decisions to be made. For example, a sales director of a company handling millions of transactions per day might be interested to know the total revenue of all transactions for a specific product category in a certain period of time, where the buyer and seller are in specific regions, and the product has parts manufactured in yet another region. Yet, long running times for such analytical queries, even in leading, commercial-level database systems, are still among the major challenges to overcome. Prof Ke Yi, an expert in database systems and algorithms, has solved a problem that has taxed the community for over 15 years, enabling responses to queries to be given in seconds rather than minutes or hours. Prof Yi and his team's novel algorithm allows the database to return approximate results in a very short time, and continue to improve their accuracy as more time is spent. Working on datasets of 100 gigabytes and larger, their "Wander Join" algorithm achieves more effective sampling through random walks, returning results with the same accuracy (for example, 95% confidence and 1%error) in one-hundredth of the time compared with prior solutions on the same hardware. The algorithm has been integrated into PostgreSQL, Spark, as well as Oracle through PL/SQL, demonstrating its viability in a variety of settings and bringing the sought-after goal of interactive data analysis a step closer. This work was carried out in collaboration with the University of Utah, and has received the 2016 ACM SIGMOD Best Paper Award.

The research by Prof. Qifeng Chen shows that an AI program can successfully render fictional novel scenes based on human input. As shown in the first figure, the deep learning model called the cascaded refinement network is able to generate photographic images based on semantic layouts. Learning-based image synthesis is connected to central problems in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, consider the problem of photorealism in computer graphics. A system that synthesizes photorealistic images from semantic layouts would in effect function as a kind of rendering engine that bypasses the laborious specification of detailed three-dimensional geometry and surface reflectance distributions, and avoids computationally intensive light transport simulation. Another source of motivation is the role of mental imagery and simulation in human cognition. Mental imagery is believed to play an important role in planning and decision making. The level of detail and completeness of mental imagery is a matter of debate, but its role in human intelligence suggests that the ability to synthesize photorealistic images may support the development of artificial intelligent systems. More recently, the research of Qifeng studies a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The second figure shows the image synthesis results by the semi-parametric approach. This approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material.
