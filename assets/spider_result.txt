The research by Prof. Qifeng Chen shows that an AI program can successfully render fictional novel scenes based on human input. As shown in the first figure, the deep learning model called the cascaded refinement network is able to generate photographic images based on semantic layouts. Learning-based image synthesis is connected to central problems in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, consider the problem of photorealism in computer graphics. A system that synthesizes photorealistic images from semantic layouts would in effect function as a kind of rendering engine that bypasses the laborious specification of detailed three-dimensional geometry and surface reflectance distributions, and avoids computationally intensive light transport simulation. Another source of motivation is the role of mental imagery and simulation in human cognition. Mental imagery is believed to play an important role in planning and decision making. The level of detail and completeness of mental imagery is a matter of debate, but its role in human intelligence suggests that the ability to synthesize photorealistic images may support the development of artificial intelligent systems. More recently, the research of Qifeng studies a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The second figure shows the image synthesis results by the semi-parametric approach. This approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material.

It is a very important problem because it facilitates drivers by predicting road conditions, enhances flight safety by providing weather guidance for regional aviation, avoids casualties by issuing citywide rainfall alerts, among many possibilities. In addition to the inherent complexities of the atmosphere and relevant dynamical processes, the ever-growing need for real-time, large-scale, and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting poses extra challenges to the meteorological community and has aroused research interest in the machine learning community. A simplified version of the problem is illustrated below. After receiving a sequence of radar echo maps up to the current time step, the task is to predict the radar echo maps in the next few time steps based on which rainfall intensities in specific locations can be estimated. For example, the radar maps are taken from the weather radar every six minutes. Over the past few years, Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and his research students have collaborated with the Hong Kong Observatory to solve the precipitation nowcasting problem using weather radar data collected in Hong Kong since 2009. By formulating precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, they first proposed the ConvLSTM model [Shi et al., 2015] by incorporating convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Using the radar echo data collected in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2013 for model training, ConvLSTM gives more accurate predictions than the current algorithm used by the Hong Kong Observatory which is based on estimating the optical flow. Recently, the team proposed a more general model called TrajGRU [Shi et al, 2017] which extends ConvLSTM in several important dimensions. A major extension is that TrajGRU can actively learn the location-variant structure for the recurrent connections in the RNN model and hence can handle more natural motion and transformation such as rotation. Moreover, the dataset has been extended to cover seven years, from 2009 to 2015. Because of the further improvement in prediction accuracy, the Hong Kong Observatory is currently porting the TrajGRU implementation to their online system for more thorough testing. This collaborative project benefits both the academic researchers and the practitioners in that it has led to publications in a top machine learning conference as well as deliverables that are being incorporated into the operational system for real-world weather forecasting.

TITLE: Towards Understanding of Engagement in Human-Robot Interaction | HKUST CSE

One of the most straightforward and effective ways is through its eyes, i.e., the cameras. The HKUST HCI Initiative thus conducted a series of HRI research to equip robots with the ability to visually perceive human status on different scales, from eyes, faces and to body poses. In natural human-human interactions, people make eye contacts from time to time to deliver very rich information to each other, e.g., attention, interest, etc. HCI Initiative studied how to estimate the level of boredom/sleepiness - attentional engagement - of participants in real-time HRI by temporal modeling of typical eye-related movements, i.e., eyelid and eyeball motions. Compared to eyes, faces provide more fine-grained information of one's shifts of attentional engagement. For an interactive robot, it needs to constantly check whether participants are facing towards it and whether they are still engaged with current interactions. HCI Initiative proposed an approach to sense participants' engagement transitions by modeling the dynamics of their face orientations as well as other social signals. Through face modeling, a robot could effectively detect engagement changes when the participants get distracted by peripheral devices. In addition to attentional engagement, faces are also highly indicative of affective engagement in interactions. In order to be emotionally intelligent, a robot should also be sensitive to such status. Many studies have used facial movements to recognize the type of emotional expressions. However, even when the same affect is shown, its intensity may fluctuate over time. HCI Initiative intends to capture the largely overlooked intensity of emotional engagement from rich gesture and body posture expressions. Thus, a model to combine body poses and faces is developed to help a robot to "feel" the subtle emotional fluctuations of its human partners throughout their interaction. The model has been tested empirically and the robot appeared to be more sensitive to changes in human emotion and thus perceived to be more emotionally intelligent. Besides being able to infer human engagement, a robot should also ensure that its human partners can understand the robot itself. A robot is still far from embracing "humanness" in interactions if its movements or motions are unreadable and/or unpredictable for human beings. How can a robot effectively express its intents, its engagement or even its "smartness" via movements and motions so that it can be understood and trusted by human partners? To this end, HCI Initiative developed a set of rule-based robot action strategies. In one user study, a robot was designed to behave either explicitly or implicitly when trying to deliver its intents. For example, when the robot detects the engagement shifts of human beings, it would react with pauses in the implicit mode, or it would speak out directly in the explicit mode. Results show that the participants always appreciated when a robot could acknowledge their engagement shift. A second user study investigated how a robot should respond to its partner's affective fluctuations. The robot was equipped with two styles of emotional responses: it can react by speech only (verbal) or it can use speech together with expressive gestures/postures (verbal+). Results suggest that verbal responses are sufficient in some occasions while gesture/postures are more effective for robots to show empathy. By applying these reaction strategies, robots are more understandable in simple interaction scenarios. HCI Initiative is exploring more complex and interesting practical applications, by exploiting more rigorous mathematical modeling and more effective algorithms.
